# autofill-leak-demo
Demo code for browser autofill leaking hidden fields.

Using autofill in certain browsers can lead to the user submitting additional information unvoluntarily. If fields that are not visible to the user have autofill set up, they can be submitted without the user noticing anything. This is a tool to test your browser for this vulnerability.
